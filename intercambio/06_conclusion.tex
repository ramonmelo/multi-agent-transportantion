\section{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work was presented a extension of the standard architecture of control of a autonomous agent using the ArduPilot autopilot controller communicating using the MAVLink protocol that guarantees communication and information exchange between a team of robots.
The experiments showed the capabilities of the extension, using the available data to take control of the agents.

Future directions include the addition of a squad control, where multiple agents can perform missions of surveillance or search, exchanging data about the supervised area among then and with a land base.
Another improvement is to add support for other types of robots and uses the individual abilities to improve the team.
