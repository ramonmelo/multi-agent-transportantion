\begin{abstract}
  %
  The use of multi-robot systems in many different contexts and applications has increased significantly in recent years. One of the main tasks focus on the transport of objects, which can be employed considering the simplest case of arbitrarily moving objects in the environment as well as in more complex scenarios, such as building structures. Despite being a relatively simple activity, many different challenges are still open. 
  %
  In this work we propose a complete methodology which encompasses all related stages of the problem (i.e. path planning, task allocation and control).
  %
  Numerous trials, in both simulated and real scenarios, were executed providing a thorough evaluation and validation of the methodology. 
  %The experiments showed the effectiveness and flexibility of the technique in respect to the task needs, such as minimizing the execution time or used energy.
