% Be an environment defined in an Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^2$, we define by $\mathcal{W} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ a convex polygon as the workspace in the environment.

% Let $\mathcal{R} = \{r_1, r_2, ..., r_k\}$ be a set of $k$ ground agents that only have the capacity to push objects using it's own body.
% Is defined by $\mathcal{O} = \{o_1, o_2, ..., o_n\}$ the set of $n$ objects that must be transported.
% All object $o \in \mathcal{O}$ are uniformly distributed in the workspace $\mathcal{W}$.
% Likewise, is defined the set $\mathcal{B} = \{b_1, b_2, ..., b_m\}$ of $m$ blocking objects that are immovable and will restrict the movement of the agents and the objects.

% To realize the transport phase, each object $o \in \mathcal{O}$ calculates a set of paths within the environment that the agents must accomplish to transport the object to its destination.
% These paths are broken into sub-paths if necessary, and included in the set $\mathcal{P} = \{sp_1, sp_2, ..., sp_j\}$.
% Each sub-path $sp \in \mathcal{P}$ is a set of points $p \in \mathcal{W}$, and represents a task in the context of task allocation.
